Chrome extension to quickly save and reload forms. Made with Angular 8, RxJS, Bootstrap 4.

The current selection of extensions on the Chrome store did not meet my needs of something that could get down and dirty without the clumbersome bloat of extra features, so I decided to ship my own solution.

Soon to be published on the Chrome extensions store!

## Install

- clone repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run watch`
- goto: `chrome://extensions` and enable developer mode
- press `Load unpacked` and target the folder `angular/dist`
